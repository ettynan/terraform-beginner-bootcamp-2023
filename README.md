# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://sember.org/)

The general format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Install the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to the gpg keyring changes. So we needed to refer to the latest install CLI instructions via Terraform Documentation and change the scripting for install.

### Considerations for Linux Distribution

This project is built against Ubuntu. Please consider checking your Linux Distribution and change accordingly to distribution needs.

Example of checking os version
```
$ cat /etc/os-release

PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg deprcation issues we noticed the bash script steps were a considerable amount more code. So we decided to create a bash script to install the Terraform CLI.

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This will allow us an easier to debug and execut manually Terraform CLI install
- This will allow better portability for other projcts that need to install Terraform CLI.

#### Shebang Considerations

A Shebang (pronounced Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program will interpret the script. eg. `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommnded this format for bash:`#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS distributions
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

#### Execution Considerations
When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notation to execute the bash script.

eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpret it.

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli`

#### Linux Permissions Considerations

In order to make our bash scripts executable we need to change linux permissions for the fix to be executable at th user mode.

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

Alternatively:

```sh
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### Gitpod lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using the Init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace.
